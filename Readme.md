## about software
the purpose of my project is to help me while learning English. Using the words used in the software industry, I wrote sentences at the b1 and b2 level with the help of chatgpt. now I am making Turkish translations of the related sentences. I do research on memorizing, telephoning, listening and writing the words in sentences and the words that are the source of sentences. I am writing this software to make my studies easier.
